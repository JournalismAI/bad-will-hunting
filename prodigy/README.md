# Prodigy recipe to annotate training/test datasets 

This folder contains the scrips to manually annotate datasets to train a spaCy Entity Linker model.
Please refer to the annotation_guide/Entity Linking Annotation guide.pdf for details on the annotation task.

## Repo structure
 
- `annotation_guide/` – a PDF version of our annotation guide for entity linking 
- `annotation_scripts/` – code for setting up the entity linking annotation server using Prodigy

Each folder contains a separate `README` file with instructions to set up and run each piece of work.
