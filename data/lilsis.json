On conclusion of his tour, Gould said he is \u201cblown away\u201d by the work that the organisations do.\r\n\r\nThe launch of NHSX comes as the Head of Design at NHS Digital this week outlined the decision to withdraw the NHS Common User Interface, which was introduced over a decade ago to standardise on the design of UIs for healthcare computing systems, but is now \u201coutdated\u201d.\r\n\r\nPart of Hancock\u2019s renewed plan for technology across the NHS is to focus on open standards, interoperability, user-led design and a cloud first approach.\r\n\r\nThe Health Secretary has said that vendors that don\u2019t comply with the new playbook for NHS tech will be phased out in the coming years, and has instead pitched a NHS-as-a-Platform model for the health service.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Health and Social Care has said that NHSX will be responsible for mandating the use of \u201cinternationally recognised technology and data standards across the NHS to ensure all systems can talk to each other\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlthough the organisation has only officially opened this week, Gould has wasted no time in exercising NHSX\u2019s new central spend controls and has carried out a review of NHS tech transformation programmes - reducing the number from 30 to 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt Hancock\r\n\u2714\r\n@MattHancock\r\nAt the launch of @NHSX - on a mission to bring first rate technology into the NHS to save staff time and save patients\u2019 lives\r\n\r\nView image on TwitterView image on Twitter\r\n211\r\n2:52 PM - Jul 3, 2019\r\nTwitter Ads info and privacy\r\n67 people are talking about this\r\nGould has outlined NHSX\u2019s key priorities as:\r\n\r\nreducing the burden on clinicians and staff, so they can focus on patients\r\ngiving people the tools to access information and services directly\r\nensuring clinical information can be safely accessed, wherever it is needed\r\naiding the improvement of patient safety across the NHS\r\nimproving NHS productivity with digital technology\r\nHe recently said that he wants the organisation to remain as \u2018thin\u2019 as possible - not building too much and allowing others to create on and use its platforms. He said:\r\n\r\nFirst, we\u2019re going to focus on standards and platforms, keeping the centre as \u2018thin\u2019 as possible. This is how the internet works and it\u2019s the only way we will ever be able to be able to transform an organisation as large as the NHS.\r\n\r\nStandards are the common technical and semantic rules that everyone agrees on in order to participate in a system. Plug sockets are a standard, URLs for web pages are a standard. In the NHS standards are essential for delivering interoperability, so essential diagnostic information gets to where it\u2019s needed. Standards also mean we can more easily \u2018plug in\u2019 new digital services once they\u2019ve been invented.\r\n\r\nBut we don\u2019t want to build many digital services ourselves. There are plenty of clinicians, charities, start-ups and NHS trusts that can do a much better job of designing new services than we can at the centre. Instead, as I\u2019ve previously blogged, we will focus on creating platforms that other innovators can build on.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly comparisons are being made between the Government Digital Service (GDS) and NHSX, given that GDS also began as a central function, with a mandate to set standards and improve the use of technology across Whitehall.\r\n\r\nImage credit - Image sourced via Pixabay\r\n\r\nRead more on:\r\nHealth\r\nHealthcare transformation\r\nRelated Stories\r\n\r\nImage of NHSX logo\r\nNHSX on the hunt for Chief Technology Officer - Salary \u00a3131,000+\r\n\r\nImage of a doctor with an iPad\r\nNHSX exercises spend control powers and reduces NHS transformation programmes from 30 to 10\r\n\r\nPhoto of Matthew Gould\r\nNHSX appoints Matthew Gould as CEO - spend controls to be introduced?\r\n\r\nImage of a number for passwords\r\nNHSX CEO says \u2018we\u2019re listening\u2019 - \u00a340m announced to reduce login times across NHS\r\n\r\nImage of a doctor at work\r\nNHS digital round-up - NHS App focuses on APIs and London Trusts launch \u00a33bn framework\r\n\r\nPowered by\r\nNew on diginomica\r\nPremier partner newsfeed\r\n\r\nHow Samsung UK and Ireland Protected Customer and Employee Experience through Remote Working\r\n\r\nHow has UKCloud adapted to this new way of working?\r\n\r\nOracle@Oracle Industry Cloud Infrastructure Story: What Really Motivates a Cloud Transformation?\r\nLatest Conversations\r\nSyncMD Getting the trust of the patient can be done through initiation.
